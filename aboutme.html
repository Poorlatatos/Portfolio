                                I begun studying at Institute Of Technical Education at this time and I learnt many things as a
                                student of electrical engineering. I learnt programming fundamentals, circuit design, and various software tools. Getting
                                my hands dirty with practical projects was a highlight of my studies.

                                Smart Control Technology was where I did my internship as a technician. I was personally involved
                                in several projects during that time, like setting up WiFi networks, electrical control systems, and much more
                                all for several companies and homes. It taught me many things on the field and I am grateful for the experience.

                                At this time at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, I am currently studying Immersive Media and Technology. Within this,
                                I've been exposed to various programming languages, game development, and interactive media.
                                The hands-on projects and collaborative environment have been instrumental in honing my skills and preparing 
                                me for a career in technology.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Here's what I've learnt:
                                <br>
                                <div class="pointers">
                                    <strong>> Game Development <br> > 3D Modeling</strong> <br>
                                    <strong>> 3D Animation <br> > Programming</strong> <br>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br>
                            What I have really benefited from learning all this is that I have become better at problem solving and critical thinking.
                            I have also gained a deeper understanding of the technical aspects of my field, which has further fueled my passion for technology and media.
                            Learning in such a dynamic environment has truly been a transformative experience for me, especially with being exposed to projects
                            that push me to innovate and come up with ideas on the dot.
